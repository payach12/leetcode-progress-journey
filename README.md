# leetcode-progress-journey

This is an accountability thread as I progress through LeetCode to brush up on my coding skills. Here's what I hope to accomplish:

-To get better at coding and problem-solving.

-To build intuition.

-A fun, productive way to fill up my time (instead of senselessly doomscrolling through reddit and twitter).

-to build a sense of excitabilty and comfort around coding, instead of the usual feelings of dread and intimidation.
 
    What to expect from this repository:
    -The goal is to do 3-5 problems a day and maintain a streak of sorts (thank u duolingo) as incentive to build the initial momentum I need. 
    -I start with problems that are marked easy for the sake of comfort, progressing to medium and hard in the next couple of weeks. 
    -Problem breakdowns that include detailed strategy and approach, and reasoning behind them. 
    -Practice and consistency over perfection.
    -weekly notes documenting how I'm going mentally, wins, challenges and much more (I have a tendency to yap, bear with me).
    -maintaining progress stamps at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12.

To the reader/viewer of this repository, if you're here and you find that I've not done good on my promise to accomplish these goals, you are welcome to hold me accountable. Feel free to contribute to suggestions and how I can better myself as I go through this journey.
